## ✅ Features Overview

### 🔐 Authentication

* Secure **Login/Signup** with Firebase Auth
* **ProtectedRoute** guards `/dashboard` from unauthorized access

### 📋 Task Management

* Create/Delete multiple **task lists** (e.g., "Work", "Personal")
* **Add/Edit/Delete** tasks within each list
* **Mark tasks as completed**, auto-reorder for clean visuals
* **Persistent**: Tasks survive refresh or logout via Firestore

### 🧑‍🎨 Dynamic Profile Identity

* Random profile image via [`picsum.photos`](https://picsum.photos/id/77/info)
* Each user gets a **unique avatar** on login, powered by external API

### 🧩 Modular Structure

* Split into **reusable components**: `TaskList`, `TaskCard`, `Header`, `TaskPopup`
* Centralized Firestore logic in `useTaskData()` hook for clean data flow

### 🧪 Testing with Jest + RTL

* Covered all critical components to ensure reliability and confidence
* ✅ **All tests passing** – Screenshot below

## 🧪 Test Coverage Snapshot

| Component        | Test Description                                      | Result   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `TaskPopup`      | Renders inputs, updates state, handles add task logic | ✅ Passed |
| `TaskCard`       | Toggles task completion and deletes tasks correctly   | ✅ Passed |
| `ProtectedRoute` | Redirects unauthenticated users to login route        | ✅ Passed |

## 📱 Responsive Design

* Built mobile-first using Tailwind CSS
* Fully responsive layout optimized for **mobile, tablet, and desktop**
* Task lists use horizontal scrolling on smaller screens for UX clarity

## 🔍 How It Works – Behind the Scenes

### 1. 🔐 User Authentication (Firebase Auth)

* On login/signup, Firebase creates a **unique UID** for the user.
* This UID ensures **each user’s data is isolated and secure**.

### 2. 🗄️ Firestore Data Storage (Per User)

* On first login, Firestore creates a document tied to the user's UID.
* **All task lists and their tasks are stored in this document**.
* State is **persistent** across refreshes and logouts.

### 3. 🧪 useTaskData() – Custom React Hook

* Centralizes all Firestore logic:

  * Fetching task data on mount
  * Updating tasks/lists
  * Syncing with UI in real-time
* This **decouples business logic from UI**, making components clean and scalable.

### 4. 🧑‍🎨 Dynamic Profile Avatar

* A random number (0–999) is generated on dashboard mount.
* This number is passed to [`picsum.photos`](https://picsum.photos) to fetch a **unique profile picture**.
* Image is stored in state and shown in the header for a personalized UX.

### 5. 🔐 Protected Routing

* The `<ProtectedRoute>` component uses `useAuthState` to:

  * Detect if a user is logged in
  * Redirect unauthenticated users to `/`
* Ensures **data is never exposed to unauthorized users**.

### 6. ⚡ Real-Time UX

* All task actions (add/delete/mark complete) **immediately update Firestore**.
* The UI reflects changes in real time, providing a smooth and engaging experience.

## 🧪 Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Install testing tools
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom

# Add setup file for jest-dom
touch setupTests.js
```

**setupTests.js**:

```js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

Add this to `vite.config.js` or `package.json` to ensure setup file is used.

Run tests:

```bash
npx vitest run
```
